name: hunk-review
description: Use when the task involves Hunk review sessions. Helps a coding agent explain what Hunk is, prefer live Hunk session CLI inspection over shell parsing, inspect current review focus, navigate or reload live sessions, and leave inline review comments.
compatibility: Requires Hunk from this repo or the published hunkdiff package. Works best with a real TTY for interactive review.

# Hunk Review

Use this skill when the task involves Hunk itself or when the user wants an interactive review workflow centered on a live Hunk session.

Start by explaining Hunk plainly: **Hunk is a review-first terminal diff viewer for agent-authored changesets.**

**Important distinction:** Hunk is an interactive terminal UI meant for the user to view and navigate. As a coding agent, you should NOT invoke `hunk diff` or `hunk show` directly - these launch an interactive TUI that you cannot use. Instead, get agent-friendly information via `hunk session *` commands to inspect and manipulate existing live sessions.

If no live session exists yet, suggest the user launch Hunk in their terminal first, then use session commands to interact with it.

## Mental model

Keep these product rules in mind:

- the main pane is one top-to-bottom multi-file review stream
- the sidebar is for navigation, not single-file mode switching
- layouts are `auto`, `split`, and `stack`
- `[` and `]` navigate hunks across the full review stream
- agent notes belong beside the code they explain

Your job is not just to inspect the diff privately. Use Hunk as a shared explanation surface for the code author.

## Default operating rule

If a live Hunk session already exists, prefer `hunk session ...` over scraping terminal output or opening another review window.

Hunk uses one local-only loopback daemon to broker commands to live sessions. Normal Hunk sessions register automatically. `hunk mcp serve` is for manual startup or debugging only. `HUNK_MCP_DISABLE=1` disables registration for one session.

## Default review workflow

Use this loop unless there is a strong reason not to:

1. `hunk session list`
2. `hunk session context`
3. `hunk session navigate` if the current focus is wrong
4. `hunk session reload -- <hunk command>` if the same live window should show different contents
5. `hunk session comment add`

Guidelines:

- if multiple sessions are live, pass `sessionId` explicitly
- use `--repo <path>` when you want the session whose repo root matches one checkout
- use `hunk session get` only when you need broad session metadata
- keep the visible review state aligned with the explanation you are giving
- prefer concise inline comments tied to real diff lines or hunks

## Precise command patterns

### Navigate precisely

Use exact `navigate` targets instead of guessing flags:

```bash
hunk session navigate --repo . --file README.md --hunk 2
hunk session navigate --repo . --file src/ui/App.tsx --new-line 372
hunk session navigate --repo . --file src/ui/App.tsx --old-line 355
```

Targeting rules:

- use `--hunk <n>` for a 1-based hunk number within the file
- use `--new-line <n>` for a line on the new side
- use `--old-line <n>` for a line on the old side
- do not invent extra flags; stick to the supported selectors above

### Add and manage comments

Use exact comment-management syntax:

```bash
hunk session comment add --repo . --file README.md --new-line 103 --summary "Tighten this wording"
hunk session comment list --repo . --file README.md
hunk session comment rm --repo . <comment-id>
hunk session comment rm <session-id> <comment-id>
```

When passing comment text through a shell, quote `--summary` and `--rationale` defensively. Avoid raw backticks unless you are sure the shell will not interpret them.

## Common commands

**For coding agents:** Use these `hunk session` commands to inspect and manipulate live sessions without invoking the interactive UI:

```bash
hunk session list                           # see all live sessions
hunk session context --repo .               # get current focus and state
hunk session navigate --repo . --file README.md --hunk 2
hunk session reload --repo . -- diff        # refresh with working tree
hunk session reload --repo . -- show HEAD~1 # refresh with specific commit
hunk session comment add --repo . --file README.md --new-line 103 --summary "Tighten this wording"
hunk session comment list --repo . --file README.md
```

**For users:** Launch Hunk interactively in a terminal (not via agent):

```bash
hunk diff                                   # review working tree
hunk show HEAD~1                            # review a commit
bun run src/main.tsx -- diff                # from source (if in hunk repo)
```

Use `hunk diff --agent-context path/to/context.json` when a local rationale sidecar already exists.

## Working-tree review playbook

For the common case of steering one live `hunk diff` session while local files are changing:

```bash
hunk session list
hunk session context --repo .
git add -N src/new-file.ts                 # if a new file is missing from the review
hunk session reload --repo . -- diff       # refresh the live working-tree review
hunk session navigate --repo . --file src/new-file.ts --hunk 1
hunk session comment add --repo . --file src/new-file.ts --new-line 10 --summary "Explain why this matters"
```

Important mental model:

- live session commands only operate on files visible in the currently loaded review
- for working-tree reviews, that means the file must appear in Git's diff
- newly created files often need `git add -N <path>` before Hunk can navigate to them or attach comments there

## Comment style

Prefer comments that help the author understand the change, not comments that just restate the diff.

Good comments usually do one of these:

- explain intent
- explain structure
- point out why one hunk matters to the rest of the change
- suggest a specific follow-up or risk to inspect

Keep comments concise and spatially tied to the code they describe.

## Common failure modes

- `No visible diff file matches ...`
  - the file is not part of the currently loaded review
  - check `hunk session context --repo .`
  - for a new file in a working-tree review, run `git add -N <path>` and then `hunk session reload --repo . -- diff`
- the session is showing the wrong changeset
  - use `hunk session reload --repo . -- diff`, `-- show ...`, or another nested Hunk review command
- navigation target is ambiguous
  - use one of `--hunk`, `--old-line`, or `--new-line`
- multiple live sessions exist and commands hit the wrong one
  - pass `sessionId` explicitly
- no live session exists yet
  - launch Hunk in a real terminal, then return to `hunk session list`

## When no live session exists

If the user wants interactive review and no live session exists, **suggest the user launch Hunk in their terminal** with a command like `hunk diff` or `hunk show`, then return to `hunk session list` once they confirm it's running.

Do not attempt to launch Hunk yourself - you cannot interact with the TUI. Only the user can navigate the interactive interface.

## Repo-specific notes

When using Hunk for agent changes in this repo:

- prefer a real TTY or tmux session for verification
- `.hunk/latest.json` is optional local context, not required repo hygiene
- if new files should appear in review before commit, use `git add -N <path>`
- if testing local source changes, prefer `bun run src/main.tsx -- ...` over an installed binary

## What this skill should steer toward

- prefer visible, review-oriented actions over shell parsing of rendered terminal output
- inspect the current live diff session before navigating blindly
- reload the current live session instead of opening a second review window when the user wants to swap contents
- use Hunk to help the code author understand the code, not just to help yourself inspect it
- keep comments concise, concrete, and attached to the right place in the diff
